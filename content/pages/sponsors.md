Robotics is a wonderful and engaging experience. Funding plays a key role in ensuring it remains that way. Even though we are a team out of the Portland Public Schools system, we receive no funding from the district. To raise money, we rely on sponsorship. Every year, students contact local businesses to talk to them about sponsorship opportunities. These conversations teach students important skills that they will then carry into their post-high school experiences. Sponsorship is a crucial part of this program, and any funds we receive go directly toward cultivating STEM experiences.
