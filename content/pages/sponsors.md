title: Sponsorships
---
While robotics is a wonderful, engaging experience, in order to be successful, funding plays a key role. Even though we are a team out of the Portland Public Schools system, we recieve no funding from the district. So, to raise money, we turn toward sponsorships. Every year, students call local businesses to talk to them about sponsorship opportunities. These phone calls teach students important skills that they will then carry into their post-secondary experiences. In short, sponsors are the only reason we can do what we do.
