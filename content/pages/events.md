## 12-2021 “Outdoor Bunnybots”

We ended the day mid-pack and were selected for an alliance where our robot performed well. A decision to remove the front bumper improved ball scoring abilities. An accidental e-stop disabled our robot for the final match but I think we were all happy to pack up a bit early and get out of the dumping rain:) 

## 10-2021 “Storm Surge”

We ranked 1st in qualification matches, making us the 1st seed alliance captain. We went on to pick a powerful alliance and won the event with an undefeated playoffs. Our robot worked throughout the whole event, and our drive team performed great in every match.

## 10-2021 “Robot Rodeo”

We ranked 4th in qualification matches, and were captains of the 4th alliance. We finished the event as a semifinalist in eliminations. We struggled with our climb mechanism throughout the event, but by the end we finally got it working and were able to climb several times. Our new drivers performed well and showed lots of potential.
