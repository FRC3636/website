# “Robot Rodeo” Wilsonville High School - 10/9/2021

We ranked 4th in qualification matches out of 16 teams, and were captains of the 4th alliance for the elimination rounds. We finished the event as a semifinalist in eliminations. We struggled with our climb mechanism throughout the event, but by the end we finally got it working and were able to climb several times. Our new drivers performed well and showed lots of potential.
