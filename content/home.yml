    content: "We are Generals Robotics Team 3636. We are a team of dedicated high
      school students from Grant High School, in Portland, OR.  For the past 11
      years, our team has competed in First Robotics Competitions (FRC).
      Starting January, our team has six weeks to plan, design, and build a
      working robot to take to competitions. Even while working with time
      constraints, strict guidelines, and tight budgets, we are able to turn out
      an advanced piece of machinery every year. Through hard work, dedication,
      and community support we are able to turn out a highly competitive robot
      every year. "
